# MagicGlove ✨
The Magic Glove is an assistive device for people who are blind or visually impaired. Created for Hack Western 9.

# Our Mission 🏃‍♂‍
The healthcare industry has an extreme lack of assistive devices in healthcare for people who are blind or visually impaired. Thus, we wanted to create a device that is affordable, sleek, and innovative. 

# The Features 🔮
The sleek design is compact with three useful features:
1)	Spatial Orientation: Notifies the user of nearby obstructions to avoid accidents or tripping.
2)	Colour Recognition: Helps users with daily life tasks including grocery shopping, clothing organizing, and more. 
3)	Light Detection: Notifies people who are totally blind (18% of the blind community) and cannot perceive light if the lights in a room are on or off. 

# Tech Stack 👾
Software: Python, OpenCV, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text <br />
Hardware: Raspberry Pi 3, Camera for Raspberry Pi, Ultrasonic Range Sensor, Buzzer, Photoresistors, Push Buttons
